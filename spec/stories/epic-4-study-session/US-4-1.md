# US-4.1: Start Study Session

## Description

As a **user**,
I want to **start a study session for a deck**,
So that **I can review my flashcards and reinforce my memory**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Study button on deck card and deck detail page
- [x] Session loads cards that are due or new
- [x] Due cards: Review.dueDate <= today
- [x] New cards: No Review record exists
- [x] Session shows progress (current/total)
- [x] Empty state if no cards to study

---

## Technical Notes

### Implementation
- **Page**: `src/app/dashboard/decks/[id]/study/page.tsx`
- **Component**: `src/components/StudySession.tsx`

### Card Selection Logic
```typescript
// Get due and new cards
const dueCards = cards.filter(c =>
  c.reviews.length > 0 &&
  new Date(c.reviews[0].dueDate) <= new Date()
);
const newCards = cards.filter(c => c.reviews.length === 0);
const studyCards = [...dueCards, ...newCards];
```

### Session State
```typescript
{
  cards: Card[],
  currentIndex: number,
  isFlipped: boolean,
  isComplete: boolean,
  stats: { again: 0, hard: 0, good: 0, easy: 0 }
}
```

## RICE Score

| Factor | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Reach | 100% | All users study |
| Impact | 3 (Massive) | Core value prop |
| Confidence | 100% | Clear requirements |
| Effort | 0.5 week | UI + state |

**Score:** (100 × 3 × 1.0) / 0.5 = **600**
