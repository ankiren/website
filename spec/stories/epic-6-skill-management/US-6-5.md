### AC-6.5.1: Dashboard Overview

```gherkin
Scenario: View my skills dashboard
  Given I am logged in as a user
  And I am tracking multiple skills
  When I navigate to "/dashboard/skills"
  Then I should see "My Skills" section
  And I should see all skills I am tracking
  And I should see a summary of my skill count

Scenario: Empty dashboard
  Given I am logged in as a user
  And I am not tracking any skills
  When I navigate to "/dashboard/skills"
  Then I should see "No skills tracked yet" message
  And I should see "Browse Skills" button to discover skills

Scenario: Skills grouped by parent
  Given I am tracking skills: Reading, Listening (under English), Grammar (under Japanese)
  When I view my skills dashboard
  Then I should see skills grouped by their parent
  And "Reading" and "Listening" should be under "English"
  And "Grammar" should be under "Japanese"
```

### AC-6.5.2: Score Display

```gherkin
Scenario: Display current score with level
  Given I am tracking "Reading" with score 75
  When I view my skills dashboard
  Then I should see "Reading" with score "75"
  And I should see level indicator "Advanced" (61-80 range)
  And the score should have appropriate color coding

Scenario: Score level colors
  Given I have skills with various scores
  When I view my dashboard
  Then scores 0-20 (Beginner) should show red indicator
  And scores 21-40 (Elementary) should show orange indicator
  And scores 41-60 (Intermediate) should show yellow indicator
  And scores 61-80 (Advanced) should show light green indicator
  And scores 81-100 (Expert) should show green indicator

Scenario: Skill without score
  Given I just added "Writing" to my tracked skills
  And I have not recorded any score
  When I view my dashboard
  Then "Writing" should show "No score yet"
  And I should see "Record Score" prompt
```

### AC-6.5.3: Quick Actions

```gherkin
Scenario: Quick record score
  Given I am viewing my skills dashboard
  And I see "Reading" skill card
  When I click the "+" button on "Reading"
  Then a quick score input modal should appear
  And I can enter score, source, and optional note
  And I can save without leaving the dashboard

Scenario: Navigate to skill detail
  Given I am viewing my skills dashboard
  When I click on the "Reading" skill card
  Then I should navigate to the skill detail page
  And I should see full score history

Scenario: Quick add new skill
  Given I am viewing my skills dashboard
  When I click "Add Skill" button
  Then I should see the skills catalog
  And I can add a new skill to track
```

### AC-6.5.4: Sort and Filter

```gherkin
Scenario: Sort by score
  Given I have skills with scores: Reading (75), Listening (50), Writing (90)
  When I sort by "Score (High to Low)"
  Then skills should appear: Writing, Reading, Listening
  When I sort by "Score (Low to High)"
  Then skills should appear: Listening, Reading, Writing

Scenario: Sort by name
  Given I have skills: Writing, Listening, Reading
  When I sort by "Name (A-Z)"
  Then skills should appear: Listening, Reading, Writing

Scenario: Sort by last assessed
  Given I have skills with different last assessed dates
  When I sort by "Recently Assessed"
  Then the most recently assessed skill should appear first

Scenario: Filter by level
  Given I have skills at various levels
  When I filter by "Advanced" level
  Then I should only see skills with scores 61-80

JOIN Skills s ON us.skill_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN Skills ps ON s.parent_id = ps.id
WHERE us.user_id = :userId
ORDER BY s.parent_id NULLS FIRST, s.name;

-- Count by level
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN current_score <= 20 THEN 'beginner'
