### AC-6.2.1: View Skills Catalog

```gherkin
Scenario: View available skills
  Given I am logged in as a user
  When I navigate to "/dashboard/skills"
  Then I should see "Available Skills" section
  And I should see all skills created by admins
  And I should see which skills I am already tracking

Scenario: Skills I'm tracking are indicated
  Given I am logged in as a user
  And I am tracking the skill "Reading"
  When I view the skills catalog
  Then "Reading" should show a "Tracking" badge
  And other skills should show "Add to My Skills" button
```

### AC-6.2.2: Skill Hierarchy Display

```gherkin
Scenario: View skills in tree structure
  Given I am logged in as a user
  And the following skill hierarchy exists:
    | Skill       | Parent   |
    | English     | (root)   |
    | Reading     | English  |
    | Listening   | English  |
  When I view the skills catalog
  Then I should see "English" as a parent skill
  And I should see "Reading" and "Listening" nested under "English"

Scenario: Expand and collapse skill groups
  Given I am viewing the skills catalog
  And "English" has multiple sub-skills
  When I click on "English" to expand
  Then I should see all sub-skills
  When I click on "English" to collapse
  Then sub-skills should be hidden
```

### AC-6.2.3: Search Skills

```gherkin
Scenario: Search for a skill
  Given I am logged in as a user
  And skills "Reading", "Listening", "Speaking", "Writing" exist
  When I enter "Read" in the search box
  Then I should see "Reading" in the results
  And I should not see "Listening", "Speaking", "Writing"

Scenario: Search with no results
  Given I am logged in as a user
  When I search for "XYZ123"
  Then I should see "No skills found" message
  And I should see suggestion to contact admin
```

### AC-6.2.4: Skill Details

```gherkin
Scenario: View skill details
  Given I am logged in as a user
  And a skill "Reading" exists
  When I click on "Reading" skill
  Then I should see the skill name
  And I should see parent skill if any
  And I should see sub-skills if any
  And I should see "Add to My Skills" button if not tracking
  And I should see "View My Progress" if already tracking
```
