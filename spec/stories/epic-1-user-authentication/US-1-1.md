# US-1.1: User Registration

## Description

As a **new user**,
I want to **create an account with email and password**,
So that **I can save my flashcards and track my learning progress**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User can access registration page at `/register`
- [x] Form requires email (valid format) and password (min 6 characters)
- [x] Email must be unique (no duplicate accounts)
- [x] Password is hashed before storage (bcrypt)
- [x] User receives error message for invalid input
- [x] User receives error message for duplicate email
- [x] Successful registration redirects to login page
- [x] User can navigate to login page from registration

---

## Technical Notes

### Implementation
- **File**: `src/app/api/register/route.ts`
- **Page**: `src/app/register/page.tsx`
- **Hashing**: bcryptjs with 10 salt rounds
- **Validation**: Server-side email and password checks

### Database
```sql
INSERT INTO User (id, email, password, createdAt, updatedAt)
VALUES (cuid(), email, hashedPassword, now, now)
```

### Error Handling
| Error | HTTP Status | Message |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Missing fields | 400 | "Email and password are required" |
| Duplicate email | 400 | "User already exists" |
| Server error | 500 | "Failed to create user" |

## RICE Score

| Factor | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Reach | 100% | All users need to register |
| Impact | 3 (Massive) | Foundation for all features |
| Confidence | 100% | Standard auth pattern |
| Effort | 1 week | Form + API + validation |

**Score:** (100 × 3 × 1.0) / 1 = **300**
