# US-1.3: User Logout

## Description

As a **logged-in user**,
I want to **logout from my Google-authenticated session**,
So that **I can secure my data on shared devices**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Logout button is visible in navigation bar when logged in
- [x] Clicking logout clears the Google OAuth session
- [x] JWT cookie is cleared from browser
- [x] User is redirected to home page after logout
- [x] Protected pages become inaccessible after logout
- [x] User must re-authenticate with Google to access the app again

---

## Technical Notes

### Implementation
- **Component**: `src/components/Navbar.tsx`
- **Handler**: NextAuth `signOut()` function

### Logout Flow
```
User clicks "Sign Out"
    ↓
NextAuth signOut() called
    ↓
Google OAuth session cleared
    ↓
JWT cookie cleared
    ↓
Session invalidated
    ↓
Redirect to home page
```

### Notes
- Logout only clears the Ankiren session, not the Google account session
- User may still be logged into Google in their browser
- Re-login will show Google account picker if multiple accounts are available
